### STL
The STL is set of C++ classes to provide common programming ds.  
STL is generalized so its components are parameterized(by using [TEMPLATES](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/templates-cpp/)).  

STL has four components
* Algorithms `#include<algorithm>`
    * Sorting
    * Searching
    * 
* Containers
    * Sequence Container: sequential acess
        * pair
        * vector
        * list
        * deque
        * arrays
        * forward_list
    * Container Adapter
        * queue
        * priority_queue
        * stack
    * Associative Container: Quickly Searched
        * set (unordered_set)
        * multiset (unordered_multiset)
        * map (unordered_map)
        * multimap (unordered_multimap)
    
* Functions 
    * Functors

* Iterators
